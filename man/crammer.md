#### Concurrent Puzzle Solver

* We define a puzzle where there are an initial state, a goal state, and a set of rules that determine valid moves. The concurrent approach uses the work queue of the executor instead of a call stack to hold the search state. Sequential approach performs DFS, that is bounded by the thread stack size, whereas concurrent approach performs BFS, that is still bounded by the set of states to be searched, or already searched.

```java
public List<M> ConcurrentPuzzleSolver#solve() throws InterruptedException {
    try {
        P initial = puzzle.initialState();
        exec.execute(newTask(initial, null, null));
        Node<P, M> solution = solutionLatch.getValue();
        return null == solution ? null : solution.asMoves();
    } finally {
        exec.shutdown();
    }
}
```

#### Crammer

OO design
- singleton, factory, adapter, bridge, visiter, command, proxy, observer

Database
- how relational db works, design schemas, and write basic queries

Distributed computing
- map-reduce, service oriented architecture, distributed caching, and load balancing

Lock-ordering deadlocks can be eliminated by fixed global order, or identity hash code, not calling alien methods, and strive to open calls. Detection and avoidance?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection
highly coupled dependency -> setter injection, interface injection, and constructor injection.
