      "When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a \"hit\". If you guess a color that exists but in the wrong slot, you get a \"pseudo-hit\". Note that a slot that is a hit can never count as a pseudo-hit. e.g.\n",
      "If the actual solution is RGBY and you guess GGRR, you have one hit and one pseudo-hit. Write a method that given a guess and a solution, return the number of hits and pseudo-hits.  \n",
      "[17.6](#17.6) Given an array of integers, write a method to find indices m and n such that if you sorted elements m through n, the entire array would be sorted. Minimize n - m (that is, find the smallest such sequence). e.g.  \n",
