Game 2: You get three shoots and you have to make two of three shots. If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other? <font color=\"blue\">p > 3 p<sup>2</sup> (1-p).</font>  \n",

Assume that each ant randomly picks a direction, which either direction being equally like to be chosen, and that they walk at the same speed. Similarly, find the probability of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon. <font color=\"blue\">p(collision) = 1 - p(no-collision) = 1 - 2/8</font>.  \n",
