      "* partitioning is splitting data into multiple instances, so each instance only contains a subset of keys.\n",
      "* two main goals: allowing much larger data sets beyond a memory limit on a single computer, and scaling IO and computational power to multi-cores, computer, and network adapters.\n",
      "* alternatives\n",
      "  * range partitioning (user id 0 to 10,000 goes to instance 0).\n",

      "  * impl.: client side, proxy assisted, query routing (a rand instance), or a hybrid (redir.).\n",
      "* disadvantages: intersection between sets, transactions over multiple keys, a big sorted set for a single key, operational complexity, adding or removing capacity.\n",
